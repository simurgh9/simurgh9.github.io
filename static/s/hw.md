# Homework Formatting Guidelines

Usually when I grade homework, I try to give as much points as I can
within the guidelines from the professor. But, if your homework looks
like you did not care for it (crooked dark pictures of hand-drawn
hieroglyphs taken at midnight) then it is hard to find motivation to
look over something like that again.

This is not to say that you must type your homework, hand written is
fine as long as I can read it _easily_. To be clear, legibility does
not imply readability.

#### When submitting handwritten work,

- Start each problem on a new page. Don't want to waste paper? Type
  your homework instead.

- Sharpen your pencil (or use a pen), if you have had to erase more
  than twice, write on a new line.

#### Generally you should,

- Emphasise your final answer when you can, e.g., circle, box or
  highlight it.

- If you are submitting a compressed file like a zip or a tarball,
  submit your main homework document (a PDF or a write-up of sorts)
  separately as a different file. This is so when I click "next",
  Canvas shows me the submission and not a notice of it not knowing
  what to do with the archive.

#### This *should be* obvious but it *never is*,

- Emphasise the beginning of a new problem/question/unit of the
  homework. Write in paragraphs. Don't write paragraphs longer than
  eight lines.

- Never submit anything without your name, date and the class the
  homework is for. Additionally, when your homework is a function of
  your OUID, you should include your OUID at the top by your name.
  
- Paper size could be letter, A4 or A5, i.e., use a scanner app or an
  actual scanner. Don't submit pages in landscape orientation.
  Otherwise, Canvas does not show all of the page and it is annoying
  to horizontally scroll each time to finish reading a line.

#### Optionally for typesetting,

If you typeset your homework in LaTeX, [here][overleaf] is a class I
use that makes my life easier. For more see [Github][github].
