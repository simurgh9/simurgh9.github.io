Shakshouka (شكشوكة/شکشوکہ) from Arabic could mean an amalgamation,
traditionally the dish is a quick toss of leftovers in a pan with
eggs. These days, however, it has become more of a recipe with its own
ingredients. And therefore, I present to you: _Shakshouka Al
Makhsūs_. What makes it _makhsūs_ (مخصوص) or _significant_, you may
ask? I set the requirement that at least one of the ingredients must
be a leftover. In this case, it was the minced beef my mother made
last night for dinner.

Oh, and the odd picture is just a squirrel I found on campus the other
day.
