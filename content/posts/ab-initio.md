Here I write on personal opinions, hobbies and interesting things I've
found on the internet. If you've found yourself offended, then the
[Samuel L. Clemens quote][twain] is for you. I.e., I am not trying (very hard

agathokakological. No problem you may have on this page can not be
solved with `Ctrl-w` or `âŒ˜-w`.
