\section{Probability and Conditional Probability}

You roll a pair of six-sided dice towards faces $a$ and $b$. If asked
to calculate the probability of rolling a twelve (sum of the two
rolls),
\[
  \text{Probabilty that }(a+b=12)
\]
in notation,
\[
  \P(a+b=12)
\]
you might answer,
\[
  \P(a+b=12) = \P(a = 6) \text{ and } \P(b = 6) = \frac{1}{6^2}
\]
What if you are asked the same question, $\P(a+b=12)$ given that
$b < 6$? You might reason that, $b \leq 5$ and $a+5=12 \Ra a =
  7$. Which as we know is impossible. Therefore,
\[
  \P(a+b=12 \mid b < 6) = 0
\]

\section{Bayes' Theorem}

The English polymath Thomas Bayes figured out that in general the
probability that event $a$ occurs given that event $b$ has occurred or
in other words, the probability that $a$ will be true given that $b$
is true can be written as the following,
\[
  \text{Probability of } a \text{ given } b =
  \P(a \mid b) = \frac{\P(b \mid a)\P(a)}{\P(b)}
\]
The above is referred to as the Bayes' Theorem. We can use the Bayes'
Theorem as one of our \textit{Data Science} models. Details follow.

\section{Na\"ive Bayes' Classification}

Assume that we are trying to learn a model $f(x) \in \{0, 1\}$ for
\textit{binary classification}. We might try approximating $f(x)$ as
$f'(x)$ by letting $f'(x)$ equal to $0$ or $1$ depending upon
whichever is more probable given $x$,
\[
  f'(x) =
  \begin{cases}
    0, & \text{if } \P(y=1 \mid x) \leq \P(y=0 \mid x) \\
    1, & \text{if } \P(y=1 \mid x) > \P(y=0 \mid x)
  \end{cases}
\]
We can simplify the above as,
\[
  f'(x_i) = \P(y=1 \mid x) > \P(y=0 \mid x)
\]
This works for binary classification, but we may use Bayes' Theorem
for any multi-class classification. Let $\Y = \{0, 1, 2,\hdots, n\}$
be the set of all possible outcomes \ie $f(x) \in \Y$, then we let
$f'(x) = y_j$ such that for all $k \neq j$ we know that,
\[
  \P(y=y_j \mid x) >  \P(y=y_k \mid x)
\]
or simply,
\[
  \P(y_j \mid x) >  \P(y_k \mid x)
\]

In other words, $f'(x) = y_j$ such that $\P(y_j \mid x)$ is maximum
(the most probable $y_j$ given $x$). This is often written as (see
question \ref{argmax}),
\[
  f'(x) = \argmax_{y\in \Y}\P(y\mid x)
\]

The crux of the matter is now that how do we compute $\P(y\mid x)$. We
use the Bayes' Theorem!
\begin{align*}
  f'(x) & = \argmax_{y\in \Y}\P(y\mid x)                             \\
        & = \argmax_{y\in \Y}\paren{\frac{\P(x \mid y)\P(y)}{\P(x)}} \\
        & = \argmax_{y\in \Y}\paren{\P(x \mid y)\P(y)}
\end{align*}
$\P(x)$ is disregarded because it's value does not change the
$\argmax_{y\in \Y}$ since it stays the same over all $y$. See
questions \ref{argmax1} and \ref{argmax2}.

The above model works when $x$ is a scaler, but what if
$\mathbf{x} = [x_1, x_2, x_3, \hdots, x_n]^T$? The model becomes,
\begin{align*}
  f'(x) & = \argmax_{y\in \Y}\paren{\P(\mathbf{x} \mid y)\P(y)} \\
  f'(x) & = \argmax_{y\in \Y}\paren{\P(y)\P(\mathbf{x} \mid y)} \\
        & = \argmax_{y\in \Y}\paren{\P(y)\P(
  x_1, x_2, x_3, \hdots, x_n \mid y)}                           \\
        & = \argmax_{y\in \Y}\paren{\P(y)\P(
    x_1 \text{ and }
    x_2 \text{ and }
    x_3 \text{ and }
    \hdots \text{ and }
    x_n \mid y
    )}
\end{align*}
Calculating
$\P(x_1 \text{ and } x_2 \text{ and } x_3 \text{ and } \hdots \text{
    and } x_n \mid y)$ may take $\O(2^n)$ unless we cut our losses and
assume (na\"ively) that $x_i$'s are \textit{statistically}
independent. In which case,
\begin{align*}
  \P(\mathbf{x}\mid y)
   & = \P(
  x_1 \text{ and }
  x_2 \text{ and }
  x_3 \text{ and }
  \hdots \text{ and }
  x_n \mid y)                      \\
   & = \P(x_1 \mid y) \times
  \P(x_2 \mid y) \times
  \P(x_3 \mid y) \times
  \hdots \times
  \P(x_n \mid y)                   \\
   & = \prod_{i=1}^n\P(x_i \mid y)
\end{align*}
Hence, our na\"ive bayes model,
\[
  f'(x) = \argmax_{y\in \Y}\paren{\P(y) \times \prod_{i=1}^n\P(x_i \mid y)}
\]

\section{Numerical Stability}
As computer scientists, we know that multiplying a lot of small
numbers results in underflow\footnote{A type of floating point error.}
errors which may greatly impact the argument maximum function (see
question \ref{underflow}). Therefore, here we need to be a little
creative with $\ln(x)$.
\begin{align*}
  f'(x)
   & = \argmax_{y\in \Y}
  \ln\paren{\P(y)\prod_{i=1}^n\P(x_i \mid y)} \\
   & = \argmax_{y\in \Y}
  \paren{\ln \P(y) + \sum_{i=1}^n\ln(\P(x_i \mid y))}
   &
   & \ln(ab) = \ln(a) + \ln(b)                \\
\end{align*}

\question\label{argmax} What is
$\argmax_{y\in \Y} \brk{100_0, 999_1, 24_2, 3.5_3, 4_4, 7_5}$? Simply
state the index of the maximum value.

\question\label{argmax1} Give,
\[
  \argmax_{y\in \Y} \brk{
    \paren{\frac{100}{4}}_0,

    \paren{\frac{3.5}{4}}_3,

    \paren{\frac{7}{4}}_5

\question\label{argmax2} If we write,
\[
  \argmax_{y\in \Y}
  \brk{\paren{\frac{100}{c}}_0,
    \paren{\frac{999}{c}}_1,
    \paren{\frac{24}{c}}_2,
    \paren{\frac{3.5}{c}}_3,
    \paren{\frac{4}{c}}_4,
    \paren{\frac{7}{c}}_5
  }
\]
for some positive $c$. Does that change the answer from \ref{argmax}?

% solution goes here

\question\label{underflow} For this question, we'll use Numpy's
function argmax \eg \texttt{np.argmax}. Numpy's argmax function
returns the index of the first value when given two equal values. For
example,
\[
  \texttt{np.argmax([1, 1])} = 0
\]

  \item What is $(1-0.55)/0.45$?

  \item Give \texttt{np.argmax([(1-0.55)/0.45, 1])}.
        % solution goes here
  \item Was \texttt{np.argmax([1, 1]) = np.argmax([(1-0.55)/0.45, 1])}?
        Should they be equal? What happened?
