This is going to be a stupid post.  In order to not be scared of
posting on my own blog, I have decided to even post the admittedly
unprofound thoughts.

The example TeX article given in [An introduction to LaTeX][tex] is
titled: _Cartesian closed categories and the price of eggs_. I
remember reading it and questioning, how does one even think of the
two in the same thought?  I still don't know.

You may feel the same way about the title of this post. This time
however, I can tell you what happened.  I was browsing Reddit and
someone with a reference to "theatre" in their username had posted on
a subreddit about a place that sells good bagels.  I got curious about
the life of someone who enjoys theatre and bagels and wanted to see
what else are they posting. On opening their profile, one of their
other questions were to the effect of, "What is an ethical source of
some graveyard dirt (for witchcraft)?"

Well, there you have it. Just when you think you have seen a lot, you
realise, there will always be surprises.
