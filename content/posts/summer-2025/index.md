The [Shakshouka][egg] has been on my mind. I found a container of
["raisin" tomatoes][raisin] at the Walmart last summer and felt like
they were easier to make a sauce with. I decided to grow my own.
Unbeknownst to me, it turned out to be quite a feat. Since I was
growing tomatoes, I decided to try and grow most common vegetables
people grow at home, e.g., cucumbers, spring onions, cilantro etc.

Shakshouka combines two of my favourite foods: fried/poached eggs and
marinara. So naturally, here we have made it twice with other foods
using vegetables from my garden this summer.
