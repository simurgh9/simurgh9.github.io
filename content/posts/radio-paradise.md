I found this radio during college in the depths of an old Linux
app. Its murmurs have carried me through many long stressful projects
and allowed me to rediscover gems like Jeff Buckley's cover of
_Hallelujah_, Leonard Cohen's _Boogie Street_ and Rabbi Shergill's
original _Rabbi_.

Oh and no ads (listener supported), human picked tracks (no AIs, thank
you) and you can play your music in Free Lossless Audio Codec!
