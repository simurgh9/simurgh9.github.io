I have recently and finally got my hands on a copy of the famous
computer programming textbook, dubbed _the wizard manual_: [Structure
and Interpretation of Computer Programs][sicp], often abbreviated as
SICP. The textbook uses MIT-Scheme (a dialect of Lisp) to express
their programs. I found this guide titled [Don't Panic][panic] quite
helpful as it seems to be the updated version of the one found at the
[MIT Open Courseware][ocw] website for the relevant course. It in-turn
pointed me to the [MIT/GNU Scheme][scheme] page where you can get the
Scheme that the textbook uses. There is also a [Homebrew
formula][brew].

Anyway, I downloaded the MIT/GNU Scheme and gave it a spin, exiting
with `(exit)`.

![Exiting MIT/GNU Scheme](scheme-exit.WEBP "Exiting MIT/GNU Scheme")

Did it just cast a hex? I looked up _Ceterum censeo Carthaginem esse
delendam._ Apparently, it means _Furthermore, I think that Carthage
must be destroyed._ From [Wikipedia][cato],

> [It] is a Latin oratorical phrase attributed to Cato the Elder, a
> politician of the Roman Republic. The phrase originates from debates
> held in the Roman Senate prior to the Third Punic War (149–146 BC)
> between Rome and Carthage. Cato is said to have used the phrase as
> the conclusion to all of his speeches to push for the war, even when
> the speech was otherwise unrelated to Carthage or foreign affairs.

Ahh, politicians: _plus ça change, plus c’est la même chose._ Thank you for your
attention to this matter! ;-)
