Seeing [Reid Quiggins][rq] on YouTube try the [New York Times (NYT)
top 50 recipes][top50], I learned that they have an entire subdomain
for cooking: https://cooking.nytimes.com/. Unfortunately, their
recipes are behind a paywall.  Although, your school or the nearest
public library may have a subscription you can use.  Or, email me
(colophon) if you want a particular recipe, and I'll gift it to you.

As you may have [noticed][tmt], I've had a bit of a tomato frenzy this
summer. Searching the NYT collection of recipes with tomatoes, I found
the [Spicy and Saucy Cherry Tomato Pasta by Alexa Weibel][weibal].
Here is my attempt at it.
