\question Assume that the probability of Alice going to class everyday given
she got a good grade is $\frac{5}{6}$ and the probability of her

\question We define a matrix of $n$ rows and $p$ columns with real values as
$\mathbf{A} \in \R^{n\times p}$. We can think of $\mathbf{A}$ as
having $n$ row vectors with the $i^\text{th} \leq n$ row vector
being $\row(\mathbf{A})_i$. Similarly, we can think of
$\mathbf{A}$ as having $p$ column vectors with the $j^\text{th}
  \leq p$ column vector being $\col(\mathbf{X})_j$.

Then matrix multiplication between $\mathbf{A} \in \R^{n\times p}$
and $\mathbf{B} \in \R^{p\times m}$ is defined as,
\[
  \mathbf{AB} =
  \begin{bmatrix}
    \row(\mathbf{A})_1\col(\mathbf{X})_1 & \row(\mathbf{A})_1\col(\mathbf{X})_2 & \cdots & \row(\mathbf{A})_1\col(\mathbf{X})_m \\
    \row(\mathbf{A})_2\col(\mathbf{X})_1 & \row(\mathbf{A})_2\col(\mathbf{X})_2 & \cdots & \row(\mathbf{A})_2\col(\mathbf{X})_m \\
    \vdots                               & \vdots                               & \ddots & \vdots                               \\
    \row(\mathbf{A})_n\col(\mathbf{X})_1 & \row(\mathbf{A})_n\col(\mathbf{X})_2 & \cdots & \row(\mathbf{A})_n\col(\mathbf{X})_m \\
  \end{bmatrix}
\]
where $\row(\mathbf{A})_i\col(\mathbf{X})_j \in \R$ is a dot or
inner product.

Further, the transpose of $\mathbf{A} \in \R^{n\times p}$ is
written as $\mathbf{A}^T \in \R^{p\times n}$ and is defined as,
\[
  \text{If } \mathbf{A}^T \text{ is the transpose of } \mathbf{A} \text{ then } \row(\mathbf{A})_i = \col(\mathbf{A}^T)_j.
\]
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]

  \item What information do the number of rows of $\mathbf{A}$ and number

  \item For the two matrices bellow, give the product $\mathbf{AB}$.

          \mathbf{B} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 & 1 \\   2 & 3 & 1 \\   4 & 2 & 2 \\   \end{bmatrix}

  \item Prove that the matrix product is not a symmetric relation \ie

        prove that,
        \[
          \beta^T\mathbf{X}^Ty = y^T\mathbf{X}\beta

  \item Let $f(\beta) = \beta^T\beta$. Prove that the derivative $\frac{\D
