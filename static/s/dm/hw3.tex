\question Please read chapters 3 and 4 of Chartrand et al. and write a couple sentences about a topic/example/concept that you found difficult or interesting and why?

\question Consider the following quantified statement: For every real number $x$, there exists a positive real number $y$ such that $y < x^2$.

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item Express this quantified statement in symbols.
	      % \[
		  %     here
	      % \]
	\item Express the negation of this quantified statement in symbols.
	      % \begin{align*}
		  %     here
	      % \end{align*}
	\item Express the negation of this quantified statement in words.
	      % here
\end{enumerate}

\question Prove that if $r$ and $s$ are rational numbers, then $r - s$ is a rational number.

% \begin{proof} % state the original proof statement here.
%     \begin{enumerate}
%         \item Assume something ...
%         \item Then, something
%         \item Therefore, % reiterate over what you proved \qedhere
%     \end{enumerate}
% \end{proof}

\question Let $x$ and $y$ be integers. Prove that if $x + y \geq 9$, then either $x \geq 5$ or $y \geq 5$.

% \begin{proof}[Proof by Contrapositive] % state the original proof statement here.
%     \begin{enumerate}
%         \item Assume something ...
%         \item Then, something
%         \item Therefore, % reiterate over what you proved \qedhere
%     \end{enumerate}
% \end{proof}

\question Let $m$ and $n$ be two integers. Prove that $mn$ and $m + n$ are both even if and only if $m$ and $n$ are both even.

% \begin{proof}
% 	here
% \end{proof}

\question Disprove: Let $A, B$ and $C$ be sets. If $A \cup B = A \cup C$, then $B = C$.

\question Prove that if $a$ and $b$ are positive real numbers, then $\sqrt{a} + \sqrt{b} \neq \sqrt{a+b}$.

% \begin{proof}
% 	here
% \end{proof}

\question Let $r \geq 2$ be an integer. Prove that $1 + r + r^{2} + \cdots + r^{n} = \frac{r^{n+1}-1}{r-1}$ for every positive integer $n$.

% \begin{proof}[Proof by Induction] % original statement.

%     \textbf{Basis:} Take $n\in\{...\}$ then we have,
%     \[
%         % base case 1  ,\quad
%         % base case 2
%     \]
%     \textbf{Inductive Hypothesis:} Assume for some positive integer $n$,
%     \[
%         % state your inductive hypothesis
%     \]
%     \textbf{Inductive Step:} We show the bellow by induction on $n$,
%     \[
%         % state the inductive step to be argued
%     \]
%     % use your inductive hypothesis to show your inductive step.

%     Then by induction on $n$ we showed that % reiterate the original statement. \qedhere
% \end{proof}

\question Prove that $\frac{1}{\sqrt{1}} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} + \cdots + \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}} > \sqrt{n+1} $ for every integer $n\geq 3$.

% \begin{proof}
% 	here
% \end{proof}

\question A sequence $a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3},\cdots$ is defined recursively by $a_{1} = 3$ and $a_{n} = 2a_{n-1} + 1$ for $n\geq 2$.
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item Determine $a_{2}, a_{3}, a_{4},$ and $a_{5} $.
	\item Based on the values obtained in (a), make a guess for a formula for $a_{n}$ for every positive integer $n$ and use induction to verify that your guess is correct.
	      % \begin{proof}
		  %   here
	      % \end{proof}
\end{enumerate}

\question In Example 4.36, we saw that $n^{th}$ Fibonacci number $F_{n} \leq 2^{n}$. Prove that $F_{n}\leq (\frac{5}{3})^{n}$ for every positive integer $n$.

% \begin{proof}
% 	here
% \end{proof}

\question A sequence \{$a_{n}$\} is defined recursively by $a_{1} = 5$, $a_{2} = 7$ and ${a_{n} = 3a_{n-1}-2a_{n-2}-2}$ for $n\geq3$. Prove that $a_{n} = 2n + 3$ for every positive integer $n$.
