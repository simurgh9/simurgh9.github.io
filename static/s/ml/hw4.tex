You're \textit{not allowed} to use any libraries other than Numpy or
Matplotlib.

We start by reminding ourselves of the variables from the class where
$x_i^T \in \R^p$ is a single data point in the data set and
$y_i\in \R$ is the corresponding label.
\[
  x_i =
  \begin{bmatrix}
    t_1 \\ \vdots \\ t_{p-1} \\ 1
  \end{bmatrix},
  \quad
  X_{(n, p)} =
  \begin{bmatrix}
    x^T_1 \\ \vdots \\ x^T_n
  \end{bmatrix},
  \quad
  \beta_{(p, 1)} =
  \begin{bmatrix}
    \beta_1 \\ \vdots \\ \beta_p
  \end{bmatrix},
  \quad
  y_{(n, 1)} =
  \begin{bmatrix}
    y_1 \\ \vdots \\ y_n
  \end{bmatrix}
\]
Therefore, the linear regression model under the appropriate
assumptions mentioned in class is,
\[
  f(x) = x^T\beta
\]

Using the quadratic error function we get,
\begin{align*}
  J(\beta) & = \sum_{i=1}^n(f(x_i) - y_{i})^2                    \\
           & = \sum_{i=1}^n(x_i^T\beta - y_{i})^2                \\
           & = (X\beta - y)^T(X\beta - y)                        \\
           & = (\beta^TX^T - y^T)(X\beta - y)                    \\
           & = \beta^TX^TX\beta - \beta^TX^Ty - y^TX\beta - y^Ty \\
\end{align*}
Note that,
\[
  \beta^TX^Ty = (y^TX\beta)^T
  \text{ with dimensions }
  (1, p) \cdot (p, n) \cdot (n, 1) = (1, 1)
\]
Therefore $ \beta^TX^TX\beta - \beta^TX^Ty - y^TX\beta - y^Ty$ is
equal to,
\[
  \beta^TX^TX\beta - 2\beta^TX^Ty - y^Ty
\]

In order to minimise this error function in terms of $\beta$ we take
the partial derivative.
\begin{align*}
  \frac{\p J(\beta)}{\p \beta}
   & = \frac{\p}{\p \beta}\paren{\beta^TX^TX\beta - 2\beta^TX^Ty - y^Ty} \\
   & = 2X^TX\beta - 2X^Ty - 0                                            \\
   & = 2X^TX\beta - 2X^Ty
\end{align*}
Set the derivative to zero and solve for $\beta$,
\begin{align*}
  \frac{\p J(\beta)}{\p \beta} & = 2X^TX\beta - 2X^Ty \\
  2X^TX\beta - 2X^Ty           & = 0                  \\
  2X^TX\beta                   & = 2X^Ty              \\
  X^TX\beta                    & = X^Ty               \\
  \beta                        & = (X^TX)^{-1}X^Ty    \\
\end{align*}

\question What is wrong with the following approach of solving the
derivative of the quadratic error function $J(\beta)$ for $\beta$
after setting it to zero?
\begin{align*}
  2X^TX\beta - 2X^Ty & = 0                                           \\
  2X^TX\beta         & = 2X^Ty                                       \\
  X^TX\beta          & = X^Ty    &  & \text{Multiply by } (X^T)^{-1} \\
  X\beta             & = y                                           \\
  \beta              & = X^{-1}y                                     \\
\end{align*}

\question Code listing \ref{line} generates and plots some linear
data. Using the equation,
\[
  \beta = (X^TX)^{-1}X^Ty
\]
plot the line of best fit in the same figure. Place the code for this
question in a file called \texttt{bestfit.py} and give the plot.

\question Read the two discussions bellow,
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \href{https://tinyurl.com/y9w2e2gr}
        {racist data destruction?}
  \item \href{https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34189684}
        {Boston housing price dataset was removed from scikit-learn 1.2}
\end{enumerate}
Do you think the data set should have been removed even if it was
unethical? Do you think the original authors were actually pushing
systematic racism or just accounting for it in their data? Discuss
your thoughts in one paragraph.

\question Download the \csv. For the description of each column,
visit,

\url{http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/datasets/boston}

For this question, we will try to predict the ``Median value of
owner-occupied homes in \$1000's.''
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Plot each column on $x$--axis against the last column on
        $y$--axis. Label the axis and title the plots appropriately. Give
        the two plots that you find the most linearly correlated. Which
        columns are these plots graphing?

        % solution goes here
        
  \item Using the two columns you picked above for $p=2$ and the
        last column as labels, split the data into training and
        testing sets. The test set should contain 100 records. Use the
        remaining training set to calculate the vector $\beta$. With
        this $\beta$ report the root mean squared error (RMSE) on the
        100 records of the training set. Note that,
        \[
          \text{RMSE} = \sqrt{\paren{\frac{J(\beta)}{n}}}
        \]

Don't use any loops for other than drawing plots in the first
part. Put all the code relevant to this question in a file called
\texttt{regression.py}.
