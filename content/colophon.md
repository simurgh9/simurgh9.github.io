# About me

Tashfeen is a tinkering computer scientist with a fair bit of intrigue
for mathematics. He enjoys teaching, running, drinking coffee, and
learning new words in different languages. His current research
interests include lattice cryptography, computational learning theory
and genetic algorithms. He has recently been dabbling in 3D printing,
botany and... _et français mais il en sait très peu sur ceux-ci_.

Albeit not an angel, when he stands next to a window in the dusk's
crepuscular light, you can almost see his halo.
